This project was for sending messages and files between any platform with an browser. No login, no installation. 

This project send data P2P using peer.js library. I do not collected or stored any data that you sent, and the data sent are encrypted in transitt.

If you find this project useful please consider supporting me by buying me a coffee, else I would not get the money for domain registration and hosting, and have no other option other than shutting it down.
